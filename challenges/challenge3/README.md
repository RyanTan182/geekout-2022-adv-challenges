# Document what you have implemented today here

1. As Challenge 2 requires me to check whether my codes are working properly, I would need to create unit test cases and just running "npm test" by creating a .yml file under workflows folder. Additionally, Linting helps me to format my codes and easily fix bugs and logical errors
2. By creating the unit tests, it links the code that we are testing through another code that fits in an example input parameter to check whether the code is working as expected with the relevant parameters.
3. I believe that by creating unit tests and linting my codes, it will allow me to fix my codes easily and be able to publish and push my codes without having to worry about fatal errors.
4. We can test out our codes by creating unit tests and setting a random input parameter to check our codes. Additionally, linting our codes is a good habit to help point out mistakes and format our codes easily.
